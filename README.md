### ✋ About me
Hi! Recently, I decided to make a career transition, which led me to dive into studying Product Management, the area I currently work in at Unilever. As I progressed, I realized the importance of understanding the technology behind the products I manage, which motivated me to start learning programming. That’s when I discovered a true passion for software engineering, particularly in backend. Since then, I’ve been committed to deepening my knowledge in programming, with the goal of building robust and scalable solutions. I love tackling complex challenges and am always on the lookout for new opportunities to learn and grow in the tech industry.

### 📚 What am I working on right now?

 I'm a passionate product development analyst at Unilever. I'm currently contributing to the Pipocaágil project, where I'm honing my skills in creating robust and scalable backend systems, where I focus on backend development. My role allows me to delve into the intricacies of creating efficient and maintainable code, ensuring the best outcomes for the project.

### 🎓 What am I learning right now?

I'm diving deep into **Software Architecture** and **Clean Code** principles. I'm exploring the best practices to write code that is not only functional but also clean, maintainable, and scalable. This journey is shaping me into a more thoughtful and deliberate developer.
