### âœ‹ About me
Hi!. Recently, I decided to make a career transition, which led me to dive into studying Product Management, the area I currently work in at Unilever. As I progressed, I realized the importance of understanding the technology behind the products I manage, which motivated me to start learning programming. Thatâ€™s when I discovered a true passion for development, particularly in backend. Since then, Iâ€™ve been committed to deepening my knowledge in programming, with the goal of building robust and scalable solutions. I love tackling complex challenges and am always on the lookout for new opportunities to learn and grow in the tech industry.

### ðŸ“š What am I working on right now?

 I'm a passionate product development analyst at Unilever. I'm currently contributing to the PipocaÃ¡gil project, where I'm honing my skills in creating robust and scalable backend systems, where I focus on backend development. My role allows me to delve into the intricacies of creating efficient and maintainable code, ensuring the best outcomes for the project.

### ðŸŽ“ What am I learning right now?

I'm diving deep into **Software Architecture** and **Clean Code** principles. I'm exploring the best practices to write code that is not only functional but also clean, maintainable, and scalable. This journey is shaping me into a more thoughtful and deliberate developer.

### ðŸŒ± What is my current side quest?

In addition to my main work, I'm researching the best practices for backend development, particularly in how to structure systems that can scale with growing demands. This includes learning new tools and techniques that can be applied to my work at PipocaÃ¡gil and beyond.
